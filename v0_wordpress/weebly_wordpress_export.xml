	    	 	 		 			 				 					 						     					 								 					 						  There are six perks I see: (1) Improve your writing (2) Develop ideas (3) Online CV (4) Connections (5) Opportunities (6) Impact   					 								 					 						     					 							 		 	    	 		 			 				 					 						       					 								 					 						     					 							 		 	   The Fears  I have many fears. What if my grammar sucks? What if my family and friends find out? What if they make fun of me, or worse, my future employer sees this? What am I even supposed to write about? I have nothing original. There are a zillion blogs out there already. The audacity to create another one!A few weeks ago my little brother did something rad. He has been remixing and creating electronic music for a couple of years now. Nothing I would ever listen to, to be honest. One day, he sends me a link: he uploaded one of his songs to Soundcloud. And you know what, it got a couple thousand views!I didn't even care how many people listened to it. I was just blown away by his courage!Of all the people I talked to, nobody so far has told me that this is a dumb idea. So this is me, trying something new.  ​The Perks  1 Improve your writing​I think once you write regularly, you automatically become a better communicator. It's not just the writing, my public speaking might improve as well. You become comfortable with putting yourself out there. This could be like a butterfly effect. Maybe I want to start a YouTube channel in a couple of years. And when the time has come, it might not feel so intimidating.2 Develop ideasAustin Kleon writes about this in his amazing book Show your work.If you have to, you will find something to write about. It's not even that you don't have something to say, you just find out what you have to say.So it's really about creating a space to figure stuff out for yourself. To sort the ideas in your head.​3 Online CVIt probably helps with your professional life.I don't know how many job interviews I had where they googled my name beforehand. Now, maybe the will find my blog. And maybe there will be something on there of their interest. So when they will invite me for an interview, we have something to chat about.4 ConnectionsAgain, Austin Kleon: If you put yourself out there, you'll start meeting some amazing people.Recently I started chatting with some colleague via Zoom. Afterwards I wanted to connect with him, so naturally I googled him.What did I find? He had a website! He even wrote about science and tech and other things I was interested in. So I hit him up straight away, having something to talk about.5 OpportunitiesNow that all these connections pop up, maybe some of them lead to new interesting opportunities. Back to the example of my brother. After he uploaded his stuff, people started reaching out to talk about collaborations, big and small.Who knows what chances this will bring. But I feel that getting lucky about exposing yourself to luck a lot.6 ImpactPutting yourself online is like the modern way of being very good at networking.I like the picture of a traveller in the old days: Imagine standing in your local village, chatting away with strangers passing by. You are sure to meet some people you connect with.But what if you were to travel to new town each week, how many conversations you could start! Not being online is like confining yourself to your little village.  ​What to write about  Well, that's a question I haven't touched on so far.​I have a couple of ideas, again generously based on Show your work.  Maybe I'll talk about it in my next article.  ​Look at this  My brothers soundcloudAustin Kleon's Show your work

      <title>How I save my money</title>

	    	I put my money into index funds (ETF).I won't get rich quick. But it makes a big difference over a long time.      Please don't take this as financial advice. I'm not a pro. This is my own research and opinion. This is also far from comprehensive.There is your classic stock. With that you lend your money to, let's say, Facebook. But now your money goes up and down with the price of Facebook on the stock market. Some people make a lot of money with that. Some loose a lot. With an index fund or ETF, you are instead buying shares of many different companies. The MSCI World is an example of an index fund. If you were to put your money into the MSCI World, you'd own a little bit of each of about 1.600 companies.That's better! Now you don't have to worry anymore how good a single company is doing. All that matters, is that the economy as a whole is doing fine. ​  Isn't it like a casino?  Let's see how the MSCI World did in the last 50 years, in the best and worst times. From left to right is the time between buying and selling.​      Source: Finanzfluss   Imagine buying MSCI World right before 2008 and selling a year after. You would have lost 42% of your money!Or instead buying in 1986. You would have made 39% gains!But this is important: If you invested over 15 years in the past, you always would have made money!So buying and selling short term, that's like going to the casino.But over a long time, the economy always goes up. ​  Does it make a difference?  Imagine you have a €1000 in your bank account. Or instead you could put it into an ETF.Let's assume 2% inflation each year. And the ETF grows by 7% each year, the average of the past 40 years.         You see ETFs won't make anybody rich quick. But the difference is huge over a long time!The real trick now is to save a bit each month. I do it with an automatic savings plan. Right now it's not a lot. But I want to save up half of every pay raise I get down the line. I've made an excel sheet where you can calculate everything for yourself:​    ETF vs Bank Calculator    How it works  It sounds a lot scarier than it is. Here is a rough idea what you need to think about:​  1 - Choose a Broker  This is a platform who sells you the ETFs. I highly recommend one that does your taxes for you! Here is a comparison for Germany.  2 - Choose an Index  I like both MSCI World and MSCI Emerging Markets. Together they cover the whole world.There are also some ETFs focused on environmentally sustainable companies.  3 -  Choose an ETF  Usually there are many ETFs for the same Index. But they all invest in the same companies.See which one you broker has. Just make sure they are(1) cheap or  "low total expense ratio", "TER"(2) accumulating or "Acc",  "thesaurierend"You can compare plenty of ETFs hereNow there is a lot more to this, like taxes. So please do your own research before deciding what works for you.  But is it moral?  I have thought quite a bit about this.​In the end you get money for value. With stocks that's lending companies money. Just like when you lend yourself money from the bank.But that money will just be used to grow the company! Is blind economic growth not a problem in itself? True. At the same time we also want to grow. We borrow money to buy houses or cars. Are we any different from companies? Or is that just an excuse to avoid the problem?​But still, you are just using money to make more money. Most people can't afford that.That's true.  Look at that  FinanzflussA German YouTube Channel which got me started on ETFs, also the source for the first pictureAli Abdaal's Article​Inspired me to write my own take on it​Two CentsMy favourite English YouTube Channel on all things money

      <title>The 5 Regrets of the dying</title>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
	    	The palliative care nurse Bronnie Ware recorded the biggest regrets of the dying.​Paul Graham summed them up perfectly:  ​"Don't be a cog. Don't shrink yourself into a shape that fits the circumstances, then turns dutifully till he stops."      Some of these snippets are directly from the book. Some are my own. Most are in between.  ​ 1 - I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me“Why didn’t I just do what I wanted? I have waited all of these years to be free and independent. Don’t you ever let anyone stop you doing what you want."Already happy people get caught up in the chase. The desire to keep up often sees people change with their surrounding.Our environment has a huge effect on us all, really. Maybe the best thing one can do is to choose the right environments, ones that suit the direction one wants life to move toward.It still takes courage to live the way one wants. But there's power in the freedom of choice.​  2 - I wish I hadn't worked so hard​“I worked too damn hard and now I am a lonely, dying man. The worst part is that  I need not have been.”"There’s nothing wrong in wanting a better life. Don’t get me wrong. ​I liked the work enough, sure. And I defnitely loved the status. But my role had come to define me in a way."There is nothing wrong with loving your work. Just don’t create a life where you are going to regret working too hard. Balance is what is important, maintaining balance.​  3 -  I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings"Tell people you love them. Tell them you appreciate them. If they react in a different way to how you hoped, it doesn’t matter. What matters is you have told them.”​So much is held back by pride or fear.  It takes a lot of courage sometimes.But that's the point. It takes courage to express your feelings, particularly if you are not doing OK.It is too easy to get caught up in life. The longer you delay this expression, the longer you are carrying things that need to be said.​​Taking people for granted is a high price to pay.“We must learn to express our feelings now.”  4 -  I wish I had stayed in touch with my friendsThere are so many different levels of friends. I had begun to think of some of my own ‘friends’ more as warm acquaintances lately. They were still a blessing.But good friendships stimulate us. The beauty is that these people take us as we are, on the things we have in common. It's natural that friends will come and go throughout life. That’s why we should value them while they are here. I suppose it is about having the right friends for the right occasion.“And what are you doing this week in regards to friends?""We need our friends. Don’t let life get in the way. "​  5 - I wish I had let myself be happier"Because happiness is a choice and one I try to make every day."Sometimes happiness takes a conscious effort. ​We have the freedom to choose what we focus on. I try to choose the positive stuff.  It is natural to want more from life. To a degree that is a part of dreaming and growing.But as we will always be growing, it's important to enjoy oneself along the way.Sometimes I base happiness on the end result. I worry about the little stuff. But none of it matters.Enjoy the process. ​Happiness is now.​  Look at that  Paul Graham - Top of My Todo ListThe blog post that led me to the book​Bronnie Ware's book​

      <title>Time vs Life Energy</title>

	    	Everything we buy really, is bought with life energy.             ​If you had a lot of money, what would you do? I think most people would stop working.A friend of mine recently bought himself a beautiful car. He saved many, many years for it. It cost certainly more then he made in a year.​It really is stunning. I couldn't believe it the first time I saw it.But my second thought was: why didn't he take a year off instead?Five days a week, he get's dressed for work, commutes to work, thinks about work, comes home, needing to decompress from work. Spending so much time on work, it becomes part of our identity. When asked we don't say "I do plumbing", but "I'm a plumber".(My website used to say: I'm a physics student  &amp; blogger. Thinking about it, I've changed it.)At some point, we don't need more money to live. You can barely call it making a living.I mean, do we come home, more full of life? At work we trade our time for money. Everything we buy really, is bought with life energy.​So how could one do better?​  Ideas   1 - Think about the life energy it costIs it really worth buying a new watch? How many days of work are that?I often think of being in Vietnam. Life costs about 20€/day there. I could do that instead.Or sit in the sun in the park. That's free.Still, there are  things worth the cos.Like a trip with friends. Anything to learn new  skills. My bicycle.I just want to be conscious about it.2 - Make our time more valuableI make 13€ an hour. Not too bad for a student. If I were doctor, my time would become at least 5 times more valuable! So one could invest in his or her education. Even if it takes a couple of years, it would still be worth it.But I don't know any doctor working 5 times less.3 - Work that gives us life energy​I don't know how many people have a job that great. I think my studies really do fulfil me. Still, they often cost me a lot of life energy.How would such a job look like? ​A job where I can choose what I want to do. Where I can explore and develop myself.Where I work when I want to. If I find that, I will let you know.  Look at that  Vicki Robin - Your Money or Your LifeSounds like a self help book.  Made me think about where I spend my daily energy &amp; how I identify with my workAli Abdaal - Time vs MoneyLed me to writing this article. About fun, benefits and cost of growth

	    	I thought it's this artificial intelligence that can solve everything.​One lecture later, this is how I would explain it.      1 -  What Machine Learning isMachine learning is just a fancy way to draw a line.Sometimes the line splits a bunch of points (Classification).Sometimes the line goes through some points (Regression).         You give your computer the points.Your computer learns to draw the line.Machine Learning is a very fancy version of this.Image that the points are not in 2 dimensions, but a million dimensions.And the line is not straight, and the line is a million minus one dimensional plane.Each point could be a picture of  a dog. Or a way to drive a car.The machine always learns from a lot of points, a lot of examples.It learns a pattern.Show your computer a million examples of a dog. That works.Ask your computer to take over the world. It will ask you for a million examples.2 - Neural NetworksNeural networks are just one way to learn the line drawing. A very good one.Better, it's a million different ways. And you have to choose one each time.3 - What its like to do Machine LearningVery hard.You have an algorithm that can learn dogs.You show him a million ways to drive a car.Your computer learns for a week. It has no idea how to drive a car.You think again. You change the algorithm.There is no algorithm that can recognize dogs and drive a car.4 - Artificial Intelligence​Machine learning is a part of AI. There is no one definition of AI.But usually AI is when we teach computers human things. Like recognizing dogs.  Look at that  Mael Fabien -  Basis of Machine LearningSource of the picture and many moreFlorian Marquardt - Machine Learning for PhysicistsGreat lecture if you like formulasNature - How AI and Neuroscience drive each otherNeural Networks that mimic the brain often work best

      <title>Creating a Website</title>

	    	About a month ago I started my blog.But how hard is it do create a website? And what does it cost?      Nothing here is sponsored. These are the options I  thought about for myself.  Of those, I only ever tried Wix and Weebly.   You need two things - (1) a platform (2) a domain.​Platform is the thing that let's you create your website.Domain is the website name, like andreas-burger.com.There are three options I would think about.I decided for a Weebly plan for 2 years at 8€ / month.  My domain costs 15€ / year for 5 years.1 - Free + EasySubstack, Medium.It's not really a website. It's more like a fancy Facebook page.The domain looks like andreas-burger.substack.com. Great to start a newsletter or blog.       Substack   2 - Paid + EasyWix, Weebly, Squarespace.It costs ~13€ / month, usually you get the domain for free.Creating is easy: you just move blocks around. It takes about a day.​But you are limited in what you can do.This is what I would recommend.13€ sounds a lot for something on the internet.But for me it's worth it. I save time. And I like having my own proper website.      Editing my website on Weebly   3 - Cheaper but HarderWordpress, Ghost. ​You will need to do some HTML.You also need web hosting ( 8€ / month ) and a domain ( 15€ / year ).This is really your own website. You can design it however you want.There are also great templates. But it will need at least a week of work.There are a lot more alternatives.​I wouldn't overthink it. The platform really doesn't matter.I think 95% is having a website with something on it.  Look at that  Ali Abdaal - How To Set Up A WebsiteWhy you should have a websiteHow much does it cost to build  a Wordpress websiteHow Wordpress works

	    	The average German is twice as rich as the average Spaniard.But the median German is far poorer than then median Spaniard. [1]      Take this with two grains of salt. I'm no expert. This is far from comprehensive. Often I picked the most shocking figures I could find.  ​Wealth in Germany is extremely concentrated.Half the people owns nearly nothing, 1.4% of the total wealth. ​[2]​      [3]   Most of that wealth is in businesses. 40% for millionaires. [2]​Few (10%) households own most (90%) of the businesses in Germany.The same amount owns shares of companies.​Other countriesThe Gini index is a measure for wealth inequality.Germany ranks about the same as Saudi Arabia. [4]One can also compare income instead of wealth.In the Eurozone, only Austria ranks worse.More unequal are the Nordic and some Slavic countries. ​[5]​How come?Inheritance. The top 1% inherits about 80% of their wealth. [6]It's mostly businesses that are passed on.And businesses are mostly free from inheritance tax.         The more you inherent, the less you pay in tax on average. [7]​Was it always like that?It used to be a lot worse.But it became a lot worse in the past decades.​Wealth inequality reduced a lot during the world wars and the Wirtschaftswunder. It was at a peak in 1960, and fell during the stagflation in the 1970s.But since the 1990s wealth inequality rose a lot.The top half doubled their wealth since 1990, adjusted for inflation.For the bottom half the wealth stayed about the same.One reason: real estate and the stock market grew immensely.These are still owned by only 10% of households.​​This graph is income, not  wealth.

Can we calculate quantum physics on quantum computers?We already have quantum computers. They are far from perfect, but we decided to test them out. We used a physics model which itself can be used to describe some quantum computers. We further went beyond benchmarking current quantum computers, glimpsing into the future by simulating improved devices."Digital Quantum Simulation of the Spin-Boson Model under Markovian Open System Dynamics"MDPI, Quantum InformationNational University Singapore, Master thesis, 2022Prof. Kwek Leong Chuan, Prof. Dario Poletti, Prof. Ulrich Schollwoeck

​Can we automatically find damaged rails?Historically rail inspection is done by professionals walking along the train tracks. We fixed a video camera on a metro train moving at 70km/h and let our code analyze the footage.We used probabilistic hough transform and a decision tree to detect and cut out the rail in each frame. We than tested three variants of Canny edge detection and four variants of thresholds against a human expert in quantifying the damage. "Detection of rail surface irregularities using Edge Detection and Image Thresholding:  a case study"​Iran University of Science and Technology, Internship, 2021Prof. Morteza Bagheri, Dr. Sadegh Lajevardi 


					
							
		
	



	
		
			
				
					
						

Can we calculate a bunch of quantum particles?With many quantum particles together it's notoursly hard to predict how they will behave. There is one calculation often repeated (called SVD) and we found a way to speed it up big time.I developed an algorithm to reorder sparse Tensors of abitrary rank to be block diagonal. The SVD is then performed on the individual blocks before recombining the results again. It's implemented for U(1) symmetric Tensors in the Tensor Network library "Syten".​"Block SVD (untitled)"LMU Munich, HiWi, 2021Prof. Ulrich Schollwoeck, Dr. Sebastian Paeckel

​How can we make superconductors work?Vorteces of magnetic flux can move around inside, making the superconductor useless. We are trying to hold the flux in place.The forces governing the movement are mostly due to nearest neighbours. I implemented a delaunay triangulation to find adjacent vorteces and calculated the forces in between them."Analyzing adjacent vorteces in a simulated type-II superconducter"TU Wien, Bachelor Thesis, 2020Prof. Franz Sauerzopf
